#### modelHayianMelor - Model that predicts number of houses damaged, trained on Hayain and Melor data. Saved using cPickle. 

Measured crossvalidation performance: 
*  Cross validation MAE:  1081.24555889
*  Cross validation R2:  0.669277099699

Predicted performance on new data set:
* MAE (Mean Absolute Error): arond 2000

#### 'Example of model usage' - Presents example of usage. 
The easiest way to apply the model will be to add new data to the matrix to preserve the order of columns. See comments in the file
