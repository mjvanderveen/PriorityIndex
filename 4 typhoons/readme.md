## Content:
* Exploration of available data
* Preparation and evaluation of the prediction model
* Final model saved in file:  Model_Hayian_Melor_Hagupit_Ramasun
* Application of the model to predict damage caused by typhoon Haima


## Model was built based on the following data:

* census data about municipalities
* meteorogical data (windspeed, rain fall)
* geographical data (distance to typhoon path)
